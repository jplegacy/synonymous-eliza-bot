ELIZA was a computer program written by Joseph Weizenbaum in the 1960s which incorporated some basic natural language processing in order to create an artificial "psychotherapist".  By taking a user's input and performing some simple matches and substitutions, it was able to carry on a conversation with a human.  Although not sophisticated by today's standards, ELIZA was a sensation at the time, with some people suggesting that it could supplant human psychoanalysts completely.    Richard Wallace's ALICE chatbot can be considered an evolution of the original ELIZA, and has won the Loebner prize (a modern iteration of the Turing Test) on multiple occasions.
